STUDY DESIGN

Details of the study design can be found in the README.txt file which is part of the data package. The data contains measurements obtained from a smartphones's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope that was manually matched to specific types of activities performed by a set of 30 candidates in total. The data is spread out across a test and train set which was merged for the analysis.
The original dataset contained 561 different measurements (the X_test/train.txt) which were reduced in the analysis to only those containing the estimated mean and std values. The meanFreq values were omitted for the analysis as they are not based on the raw measurements of tAcc-XYZ (accelerometer) and tGyro-XYZ (gyroscope). This leads to a set of 66 measurements to which the corresponding activity ids (y_test/train.txt) and subject ids (subject_test/train.txt) were added resulting in a dataset with 10299 observations and 68 variables (working dataset). The activity ids were replaced with human readable strings obtained via the activity_labels.txt annotation and the variables were labeled via the names provided in features.txt. Those names are concise, yet human-readable identifiers for the measurement categories, so only limited changes were made to them to make them easier to understand. See below for details.
To obtain the desired mean values for each measurement, the dataset was grouped by subject id and activity. Then, the mean value was calculated for each measurement and the result stored as a new (tidy) dataset. This data set contains 180 observations (a unique pair of subject id and activity label) and the calculated mean values for the 66 measurements of the working data set.
