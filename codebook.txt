STUDY DESIGN

Details of the original study design can be found in the README.txt file which is part of the data package. The data contains measurements obtained from a smartphones's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope that was manually matched to specific types of activities performed by a set of 30 candidates in total. The data is spread out across a test and train set which was merged for the analysis.
The original dataset contained 561 different measurements (the Xtest/train.txt) which were reduced in the analysis to only those containing the estimated mean and std values. The meanFreq values were omitted for the analysis as they are not based on the raw measurements of tAccxyz (accelerometer) and tGyroxyz (gyroscope). This leads to a set of 66 measurements to which the corresponding activity ids (ytest/train.txt) and subject ids (subjecttest/train.txt) were added resulting in a dataset with 10299 observations and 68 variables (working dataset). The activity ids were replaced with human readable strings obtained via the activitylabels.txt annotation and the variables were labeled based on the names provided in features.txt. Those names are concise, yet humanreadable identifiers for the measurement categories, so only limited changes were made to them to make them easier to understand and better to work with. See below for details.

The goal of this study was to obtain the desired mean values for each measurement for each subject and each activity. The reduced dataset (as explained above) was grouped by subject id and activity. Then, the mean value was calculated for each measurement by those groups and the result stored as a new (tidy) dataset. This data set contains 180 observations (each a unique pair of subject and activity) and the calculated mean values for the 66 measurements of the working data set.

CODE BOOK

Notes: 	xyz is used to abbreviate 3 separate variables for each of the three dimensions
	std refers to standard variation 
	fftrefers to Fast Fourier Transformation
	magnt regers to Magnitude
	All signals are time domain signals:
	Accleration (acc) is generally measured in meters per second and the gyrometer (gyro) measures degrees per second.
